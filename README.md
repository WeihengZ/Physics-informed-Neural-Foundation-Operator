This is the Github repository of Physics-informed Deep Compositional Operator Network. The codes and datasets associated with our paper will be made available shortly. Please stay tuned for our latest updates.

# PI-DCON

This model can infer the solutions of partial differential equations (PDEs) with varying parameters in irregular geometries, purely trained in physics-informed manner wihtout any FEM computation. [paper link](https://arxiv.org/html/2404.13646v1)
